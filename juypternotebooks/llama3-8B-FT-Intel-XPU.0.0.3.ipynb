    "## Fine-Tuning LLaMa 3 8B Instruct on Intel Max Series GPUs: An Exciting Journey\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this guide, we embark on an exciting journey to fine-tune the powerful LLaMa 3 8B Instruct model using a custom dataset on Intel Max Series GPUs. Intel GPUs offer incredible speed and cost-effectiveness, making them an attractive choice for training large language models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I successfully trained the LLaMa 3 8B Instruct model using my custom dataset, leveraging the power of HuggingFace. By importing my dataset, obtaining the LLaMa 3 8B Instruct model, and training it using the Transformer Trainer, I was able to achieve outstanding results.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The entire training process was meticulously monitored by Weights and Biases, providing detailed insights into memory usage, disk I/O, training loss, and more. It's truly an outstanding product!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The best part? It's all free! I was amazed by the capabilities of the Intel Developer Cloud, particularly for machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC), and generative AI (GenAI) workflows. The Intel® Data Center Max 1100 GPU, a high-performance 300-watt double-wide AIC card, features 56 Xe cores and 48 GB of HBM2E memory, delivering exceptional performance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the spirit of open source, I developed the following notebook, partially based on the original work of Rahul Unnikrishnan Nair from Intel, \"Fine-tuning Google's Gemma Model on Intel Max Series GPUs.\" Thank you for the foundation. I was able to significantly tweak and create a process to fine-tune LLaMa 3 models, which represent a significant leap from LLaMa 2 in terms of capabilities. It's amazing how such small models can produce great results with quality data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I will be producing a detailed video review of the notebook, which you can find on my YouTube channel: [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OszhqWsF1tqqECdeLI_7Q).\r\n",

    "    - r: Set to 64, this parameter controls the dimension of the low-rank decomposition, balancing model capacity and efficiency.\n",
    "    - lora_alpha: Set to 16, this scaling factor adjusts the output of the low-rank decomposition, influencing the strength of the adaptation.\n",
    "    - lora_dropout: Set to 0.5, this dropout rate applies regularization to the LoRA layers to prevent overfitting. A higher value increases regularization.\n",
    "    - bias: Set to \"none\", indicating no bias is added to the LoRA layers.\n",
    "    - target_modules: Specifies the layers where the low-rank adaptation will be applied. Here, it includes \"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", and \"output_proj\".\n",
    "    - task_type: Set to \"CAUSAL_LM\", indicating that this configuration is for a causal language modeling task.\n",
    "    - This configuration optimizes the model's training efficiency and performance by carefully adjusting the parameters and specifying the target modules for low-rank adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Configure relevant environment variables for logging and configuration, including Weights and Biases project settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load Datasets**:\n",
    "   - Load the training and validation datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configure Training Parameters**:\n",
    "   - Set training parameters including batch size, gradient accumulation steps, learning rate, and mixed precision training.\n",

    "6. **Initialize Trainer**:\n",
    "   - Initialize the `SFTTrainer` with LoRA configuration, including training arguments and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Optimize Performance**:\n",
    "   - Clear the XPU cache before starting the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Begin Training**:\n",
    "   - Start the training process.\n",
    "   - Print a summary of the training results, including total training time and samples processed per second.\n",
    "   - Handle any exceptions to ensure smooth execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Save the Model**:\n",
    "   - Save the fine-tuned LoRA model to the specified path for future use.\n",

    "## Happy Fine-Tuning! 😄✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on reaching this exciting milestone! You now possess the tools and knowledge to fine-tune the powerful LLaMA 3 model on your own custom datasets. This achievement opens up a world of possibilities for you to explore and unleash the full potential of this cutting-edge language model.\n",
    "We encourage you to embrace the spirit of experimentation and exploration. Feel free to customize and adapt this notebook to fit your specific use case. Try different datasets, tweak the hyperparameters, and observe how the model's performance evolves. This hands-on experience will deepen your understanding and allow you to tailor the model to your unique requirements.\n",
    "Moreover, we invite you to share your fine-tuned models and experiences with the broader community. Consider open-sourcing your work on platforms like GitHub or Hugging Face, and write blog posts to detail your fine-tuning journey. Your insights and achievements can inspire and assist others who are embarking on their own fine-tuning projects, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment for knowledge sharing.\n",
    "If you encounter any challenges or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out and provide feedback. We value your input and are committed to making this notebook and the fine-tuning process as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Your feedback will help us refine and enhance the resources available to the community.\n",
    "Remember, the journey of fine-tuning language models is an iterative and continuous process. Embrace the challenges, celebrate your successes, and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Together, we can unlock the full potential of these powerful models and drive innovation in various domains."
